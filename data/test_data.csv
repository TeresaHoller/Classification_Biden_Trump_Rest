Therefore, any provisions for review of cases by the Supreme Court that cast upon that Court the duty of passing on questions of evidence and the construction of particular forms of instruments, like indictments, or wills, or contracts, decisions not of general application or importance, merely clog and burden the Court and render more difficult its higher function, which makes it so important a"

699,1,. But Egypt and Qatar have assured me and they are continuing to work to ensure that Hamas doesn’t do that. And the United States will help ensure that Israel lives up to their obligations as well. That’s what this deal says. That’s what it says. And we’ll do our part. This is truly a decisive moment. Israel has made their proposal. Hamas says it wants a ceasefire
700,2,". Yet we do what we must. I am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got, to end this battle and to return our sons to their desires. Yet as long as others will challenge America's security and test the clearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see the promise of two centuries tremble. I believe tonight that you do not want me to try that risk"
701,2,". I would say that not all of it is changing. I would say that all through our history, as these changes occurred, there has been violence connected with them.

707,2,". This winter, some will be without heat and everyone will be paying much more simply to keep home and family warm. If you ever had any doubt of the government’s inability to provide for the needs of the people, just look at the utter fiasco we now call “the energy crisis"

Thereupon I reviewed these alternatives, in the light of President Grant’s measured words, uttered in 1875, when after seven years of sanguinary, destructive, and cruel hostilities in Cuba he reached the conclusion that the recognition of the independence of Cuba was impracticable and indefensible, and that the recognition of belligerence was not warranted by the facts according to the tests of"

As smart as he was, he found his way into our kitchen cabinet. And, sadly, the rest is history. He got hooked on it, and had to go to the street eventually. And he found fentanyl"
712,1,". Not much of a student of history. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance. Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia’s brutal tactics have strengthened the resolve. Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been"
713,2,". THE PRESIDENT. I am not familiar with that. Who says that? MR. RATHER. There is Mr. Dellinger, for one, who led the march on the Pentagon, who said there was no way to get the attention of the establishment--that is, the Government. THE PRESIDENT. I don't think that is correct at all. We read the papers, we see the television, we read our correspondence"
714,1,". Today, I’m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.

716,1,". Pride. That sense of self-worth. I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do. To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well"

721,0,". States will be asked to cover 25 percent of the cost using existing funding, such as the tens of billions of dollars available to them through the Coronavirus Relief Fund. Under this plan, states will be able to offer greater benefits if they so choose, and the federal government will cover 75 percent of the cost. So we’re all set up. It’s $400 per week"
722,0,". This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success.

724,0,". Hopefully we will never have to use the kind of power that I’m building and helping to build for you. Hopefully people will look at us and they’ll say, “Let’s pass. Let’s pass.” America is a peace-loving nation. We do not seek conflict. But if conflict is forced upon us, we will defend ourselves. And if we must, we will fight and we will do nothing but win"
725,0,". THE PRESIDENT: With who? Q: The North Koreans. THE PRESIDENT: I don’t want to say. I won’t say that. Q: Okay, so — THE PRESIDENT: We have a good relationship with North Korea—as good as you can have. I mean, we have a good relationship with North Korea. I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and I hope he’s okay. And somebody would say, “Oh, that’s terrible.” No, it’s not terrible"
726,0,". Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America’s job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women — almost everyone. Incomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle"

728,0,". We were able to get them ventilators. You haven’t heard—other than, you know, there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, “We want ventilators.” They got the ventilators. You don’t have that anymore. And the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, Jon, we’ve got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now"
729,1,". Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding—the other Allies, the rest of NATO—adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense. And today, within hours of Russia’s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated—an activation of response plans"
730,2,". It is far better for the development of the territory that it be committed to a commission to be appointed by the Executive, with limited legislative powers sufficiently broad to meet the local needs, than to continue the present insufficient government with few remedial powers, or to make a popular government where there is not proper foundation upon which to rest it"
731,0,". But, no, we’re going to find out. That’s going to be a very interesting question, with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can’t beat us at the ballot. They can’t beat us at the ballot. And they’re not going to win the presidential. We’re having great polls. We have internal polls that are — Ohio, Iowa. Pennsylvania is looking good. North Carolina"

733,2,". In the middle of the cold war, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian Government. Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians. This history is well known"

And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security. Always. The American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency
737,1,". We delivered justice to bin Laden on May 2nd, 2011—over a decade ago. Al Qaeda was decimated. I respectfully suggest you ask yourself this question: If we had been attacked on September 11, 2001, from Yemen instead of Afghanistan, would we have ever gone to war in Afghanistan—even though the Taliban controlled Afghanistan in 2001? I believe the honest answer is “no"
738,0,". And we’ll be announcing them tomorrow. This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC Plus—that’s OPEC plus additional energy-producing nations—representing many of the world’s largest oil-producing countries to stabilize oil markets.

740,1,". Period. Now, it’s no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States—and I, as President—champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy. The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world. Because I believe democracy remains humanity’s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time"
741,1,". As President Truman said in 1945, the U.N. Charter—and I quote—is “proof that nations, like men, can state their differences, can face them, and then can find common ground on which to stand.” End of quote. That common ground was so straightforward, so basic that, today, 193 of you—193 member states—have willingly embraced its principles. And standing up for those principles for the U.N"
742,2,". The vicissitudes of peace and war had attended our Government; violent parties, watchful to take advantage of any seeming usurpation on the part of the Executive, had distracted our councils; frequent removals, or forced resignations in every sense tantamount to removals, had been made of the Secretary and other officers of the Treasury, and yet in no one instance is it known that any man,"
743,1,". Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions.

744,2,". Domestic manufactures to the value of several millions of dollars, which can not find a market at home, are annually exported to foreign countries.

745,1,"Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight, I’d like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic. A year ago, we were hit with a virus that was met with silence and spread unchecked. Denials for days, weeks, then months that led to more deaths, more infections, more stress, and more loneliness"
746,2,". Instead of adding strength to the federal government, even when successful they must ever prove a source of incurable weakness by alienating a portion of those whose adhesion is indispensable to the great aggregate of united strength and whose voluntary attachment is in my estimation far more essential to the efficiency of a government strong in the best of all possible strength—the confidence"
747,0,". Where is Tim? What a good guy Tim is. Tim. See him over there someplace? Thank you, Tim. But we’re investing in distressed communities to create more jobs for those who have too often been left behind. And Tim worked hard on that.

They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They’ve done a terrible job and they shouldn’t be awarded"
756,2,". Therefore, I am today signing the necessary Presidential proclamation and Executive orders that will put this plan into effect.

757,2,". And this is important, because no development strategy can be based only upon what comes out of the ground, nor can it be sustained while young people are out of work. Many Gulf States have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader development"
758,0,". And with testing, you know, testing is a double-edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. It’s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany’s done a lot.

When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases"
759,2,.

We’re also expanding refugee access to cover other vulnerable Afghans who worked for our embassy: U.S. non-governmental agencies—or the U.S. non-governmental organizations; and Afghans who otherwise are at great risk; and U.S. news agencies. I know that there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans—civilians sooner
764,1,". In the years ahead, there may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with AI. Let me close with this. Even as we navigate so much change, one thing must not change: We must never forget who we’re here to represent. “We the People.” These are the first words of our Constitution, the very idea of America. And they inspired the opening words of the U.N. Charter"
765,2,". I will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the uncared—for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by increasing our research—and we will"

In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande, near an area known as Cartel Island — doesn’t sound too nice to me — when heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them.

As the old saying goes, “Hope springs eternal.” I know we’ve talked a lot about famous people, but I’m—my colleagues in the Senate used to kid me because I was always quoting Irish poets. They think I did it because I’m Irish. They think I did it because we Irish—we have a little chip on our shoulder. A little bit, sometimes"

That’s where we need to focus our energy—not in the past, not on divisive culture wars, not on the politics of grievance, but on a future we can build together. The MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed, everyone else has to fail"

779,0,". These really phony polls — I have to call them phony polls, fake polls — were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans’ ability to raise funds.

781,2,". MR. SCHERER. Mr. President, much has been made of your 1964 campaign statement about not sending American boys to fight in an Asian war. As you look back on that now, was that a pledge, a hope, or was it simply a statement of principle in a larger context? THE PRESIDENT"
782,0,". In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.

892,0,". We believe every American has the right to grow up in a safe home and attend a good school and to have access to a really great job. And we know that, for Americans, nothing—absolutely nothing—is out of reach because we don’t know the meaning of the word “quit.” We don’t quit. And the Republican Party certainly hasn’t quit—because if we did, we wouldn’t be here today"
893,0,". There’s a group out there of our HIV/AIDS activists and community workers that understand these tests that I’ve been talking about, these DNA—these RNA-based tests. Because they often get viral loads in HIV. But they will know how to explain this to the community, about sampling and what it means to run those assays. They are essentially virologists. They understand all of these assays"
894,0,". And we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -– families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns"
895,1,". In fact, the snack companies think you won’t notice if they change the size of the bag and put a hell of a lot fewer — same — same size bag — put fewer chips in it. No, I’m not joking. It’s called “shrink-flation.” Pass Bobby Casey’s bill and stop this. I really mean it. You probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars"
896,1,". They challenge none of that. The President’s name was first, then we went down the line—governors, senators, House of Representatives. Somehow, those results were accurate on the same ballot, but the presidential race was flawed? And on the same ballot, the same day, cast by the same voters. The only difference: The former President didn’t lose those races; he just lost the one that was his own"
897,0,". Leaders in Washington imposed on the country an immigration policy that Americans never voted for, never asked for, and never approved—a policy where the wrong people are allowed into our country and the right people are rejected. American citizens, as usual, have been left to bear the cost and to pick up the tab. On top of everything else, our leaders drifted from American principles"
898,2,". No one can say at this point what form future cooperation among our three countries will take. But if I am elected President, I would be willing to invite each of our neighbors to send a special representative to our government to sit in on high level planning sessions with us, as partners, mutually concerned about the future of our Continent"

900,0,. I’d like to start my remarks today by echoing what my colleagues at the CDC have been saying regarding the health and safety of our essential employees across the United States
901,0,". Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home. I am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars. Above all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the government answers to the people"
902,1,". They seem no longer to want to be the party—the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan, the Bushes. But whatever my other disagreements are with Republicans who support the rule of law and not the rule of a single man, I will always seek to work together with them to find shared solutions where possible. Because if we have a shared belief in democracy, then anything is possible—anything"
903,1,". We have——we have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone. Today we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11"
904,0,". We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day’s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training"
905,1,". Their recommendation was that the safest way to secure the passage of the remaining Americans and others out of the country was not to continue with 6,000 troops on the ground in harm’s way in Kabul, but rather to get them out through non-military means"
906,0,". They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we’re doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody’s coming in. Very few people"
907,1,". You decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back policies? THE PRESIDENT: To roll back what? I’m sorry. Q Did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor? THE PRESIDENT: First of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all — did not slow up the amount of immigration — and there’s many people coming"
908,2,". Of these, the charge upon the Treasurer in consequence of the Cherokee treaty alone, without adverting to others arising out of Indian treaties, has already exceeded $5,000,000; that for the prosecution of measures for the removal of the Seminole Indians, which were found in progress, has been nearly 14 millions, and the public buildings have required the unusual sum of nearly three millions"
909,0,". The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens. You embrace mothers with care and compassion. You are powered by prayer, and motivated by pure, unselfish love"
910,2,". First, we will continue to support the limited test ban treaty, which has made the air cleaner. We call on the world""especially Red China--to join the nations which have signed that treaty. Second, we will continue to work for an ending of all nuclear tests of every kind, by solid and verified agreement"
911,1,". When I said I’d get 100 million done, people thought it was a significant exaggeration. We’re going to get 200 million done — twice the original goal — because of all the help of all of you. Leading economists are now predicting our economy will grow 6 percent this year. That’s a rate we haven’t seen in years and years. We can cut child poverty in half this year"
912,0,". My administration continues to leverage the Defense Production Act to dramatically increase the manufacture and delivery of critical medical supplies. We finalized three contracts to produce 39 million more N95 masks in 90 days. And as you know, we’re also using a sterilization process. Some great equipment that will sterilize the masks up to 20 times per mask"
913,0,". The United States has never believed in permanent enemies. We want partners, not adversaries. America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace. For this same reason, we have pursued bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula"
914,2,". In the Provinces of New Mexico and of the Californias little, if any, further resistance is apprehended from the inhabitants to the temporary governments which have thus, from the necessity of the case and according to the laws of war, been established"
915,2,". It is hoped that the decision of the Mexican Congress, to which our last overture has been referred, may result in a speedy and honorable peace. With our experience, however, of the unreasonable course of the Mexican authorities, it is the part of wisdom not to relax in the energy of our military operations until the result is made known"
916,1,". The National Institute of Health—the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. And that would—here’s what it would do. It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer"
917,2,". A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly urged, among other reasons, by the important considerations that they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if timely and judiciously applied, they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge the"
918,2,". So if Klansmen hear my voice today, let it be both an appeal and a warning to get out of the Ku Klux Klan now and return to a decent society before it is too late. I call on every law enforcement officer in America to insist on obedience to the law and to insist on respect for justice"
919,0,". They never used it before. An article written today: “Never heard him use it before.” But today, you know, it’s one of those things. But, you know, it’s a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly running for President. But, Josh Hawley, I want to thank you. You were right from the beginning. Man, did I make a good choice. Thank you, Josh. Tremendous future"
920,1,". We will save democracy. As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life. Because I see the future that is within our grasp. Because I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity. We are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity"
921,0,". Thank you. I have such respect for these people. Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families. I have great respect for these people. These are great people. These are great people. They’re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country. And the press doesn’t cover them; they don’t want to, incredibly. And they’re not treated the way they should be"
922,0,". We’re currently witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history—world history. By contrast, Biden presided over the worst, the weakest, and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. It was a long, slow slog, and it was a very small—very small on growth and very small on every other factor that you need. It was the weakest recovery"
923,2,. At the beginning of the nineteenth century there was not a mile of steam railroad on the globe. Now there are enough miles to make its circuit many times. Then there was not a line of electric telegraph; now we have a vast mileage traversing all lands and seas. God and man have linked the nations together. No nation can longer be indifferent to any other
924,0,". I think he was surprised also. We did discuss it prior to. She’s going to be fine, but he thought that she would not, most likely, have the virus. Unfortunately, she does. But we didn’t discuss the border yesterday, no. Go ahead, please. If you have any questions for these great geniuses up here, you should—even a business question related to what we’re talking about. Q: Mr"
925,2,". If there be any difference, it would seem that the obligation is the stronger in relation to the former, because the neglect is in his presence and the remedy at hand"
926,2,". Wholesale prices are lower tonight than they were in August. So are retail food prices. Monetary conditions are also easing. Most interest rates have retreated from their earlier peaks. More money now seems to be available. Given the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly seek, I am confident that this movement can continue"
927,0,". And I’ll tell you, I have so many people that are so in favor—because we have to make our country truly great again. Remember? “Make America Great Again.” And then, in two and a half years, it’s called, “Keep America Great.” So the way we keep America great is to make at least reasonable—I’m not saying—at least reasonable, at least fair trade deals"
928,1,". Not anymore. I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict. I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating"
929,2,. But the choice is clear. We can go on letting the country slip over the brink to financial ruin with the disaster that it means for the individual or we can find the will to work together to restore confidence in ourselves and to regain the confidence of the world. I have lived through one depression
930,0,". Now, why would they want, in this bill—which really has nothing to do with what we’re talking about: stimulus—something banning voter ID? In every single state, they want to ban it, including states where we already have it, because we have some states where we have it—Indiana and others that do very well"
931,2,"Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States passed on the 29th day of May, 1830, it is provided that whenever the President of the United States shall receive satisfactory evidence that the Government of Great Britain will open the ports in its colonial possessions in the West Indies, on the continent of South America, the Bahama Islands, the Caicos, and the Bermuda or Somer Islands to"
932,0,"made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom"
933,2,. The reports from the Departments of War and of the Navy will inform you more in detail of the measures adopted in the emergency in which our country was placed and of the gratifying results which have been accomplished. The various columns of the Army have performed their duty under great disadvantages with the most distinguished skill and courage
934,0,". And that, in particular, refers to Iran. Under my leadership, we have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and recently, American Special Operations Forces killed the terrorist leader known as al-Baghdadi. The world is a safer place without these monsters"
935,2,"requiring them, and such records to be kept of all official stamp supplies as will enable the Post-Office Department to maintain a proper postage account covering the entire volume of free Government mail"
936,2,". And is it not significant that it was then, and then for the first time, that women became prominent in politics in America? Not many women; those prominent in that day were so few that you can name them over in a brief catalogue, but, nevertheless, they then began to play a part in writing, not only, but in public speech, which was a very novel part for women to play in America"
937,2,. There have been four wars in my lifetime and I’ve seen our country face financial ruin in depression. I have also seen the great strength of this nation as it pulled itself up from that ruin to become the dominant force in the world
938,2,". So that what we have to realize in dealing with forces of this sort is that we are dealing with the substance of life itself. I have felt as I sat here to-night the wholesome contagion of the occasion. Almost every other time that I ever visited Atlantic City, I came to fight somebody. I hardly know how to conduct myself when I have not come to fight against anybody, but with somebody"
939,2,". They will have their signs. They will be charging us with murder, and this and that, because we are trying to carry out our obligations and our treaty commitments and protect that flag. MR. REYNOLDS. You feel, sir, apparently, that the press, the television, radio, the whole works, gives a disproportionate share of attention to this? THE PRESIDENT. No, I didn't say that. I said they report it"
940,0,". So important. One of the strengths of the Republican Party is that we’re a big tent with many diverse views, but the one thing we can all agree on—and that’s that, in every decision, we make our highest priority to serve and to protect the American people. We want an immigration policy that’s fair, equitable, but that’s going to protect our people"
941,0,". It was done in house. Steve? Q: But just to be clear, this was produced by government employees, by people here at the White House—this campaign-style video here? THE PRESIDENT: I wouldn’t use the word “produced.” All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don’t think that’s going to work"
942,2,". The power of removal was a topic of solemn debate in the Congress of 1789 while organizing the administrative departments of the Government, and it was finally decided that the President derived from the Constitution the power of removal so far as it regards that department for whose acts he is responsible"
943,0,". We ask God to give you wisdom and courage. I know you will make us all very, very proud. As long as we are loyal to our founding and to our fellow citizens, America’s future will be bright, America’s destiny will be great, and America’s people will forever and always be free. I now ask Justice Thomas to administer the Oath. Thank you very much. JUSTICE BARRETT: Thank you. Thank you so very much"
944,2,". Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is more than $5 a month, it is small compared to their own. How long it will take I cannot prophesy. I only know that the will of the American people, I think, is tonight being tested"
945,0,". And the hospital emergency preparedness plan allows them to defer elective issues to keep those hospital beds open for those who might need it. So we’re in full planning mode for each of those things. THE PRESIDENT: And I might add that we’re in the process—and, in some cases, have already done it—ordered a large number of respirators, just in case"
946,2,". And this means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and killed 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be successfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces"
947,2,.The American Bar Association has had before it the question of reducing the burden of litigation involved in reversals on review and new trials or re-hearings and in frivolous appeals in habeas corpus and criminal cases. Their recommendations have been embodied in bills now pending in Congress
948,0,". That’s page 1,689; page 1,762. Think of it: 1,762. And that’s nowhere near the end of their bill. They have things in there that nobody has even at the time to look at or read. These people—I don’t—I honestly don’t believe they love our country, you want to know the truth"
949,0,". Would you tell them a little bit about what you have planned for drug prices and also opioids, in terms of stoppage? Please. Secretary. SECRETARY AZAR: Well, thank you, Mr. President. And, you know, you’ve done a lot already to tackle this issue of drug pricing. So, last year, the FDA approved more generic drugs than it ever has in its history"
950,0,". Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Together, we will end the scourge of drug addiction in America once and for all. We will win. We will beat it. We’ll be tough. We’ll be smart. We’ll be kind. We’ll be loving. We’ll do whatever we have to do. But we’re going to win. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
951,1,". At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion—in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion"
952,0,". Washington has been very tough, in particular, a nursing home. And, but Washington, the State of Washington has been very tough. It’s been a big percentage of—when you talk about the 40 deaths, that’s been has been a big percentage of the deaths, as you know very well. And they all came from a very certain area, unfortunately. Please, go ahead. Q: Mr. President — THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead. Okay"
953,1,". I know that. I was 29 years old. Back then, we were living through an inflection point, a moment of tension and uncertainty. The world was divided by the Cold War. The Middle East was headed toward war. America was at war in Vietnam, and at that point, the longest war in America’s history. Our country was divided and angry, and there were questions about our staying power and our future"
954,0,". We’re getting only the highest level. And also, we’re looking at essential gear within their states, and it’s being delivered to different states quickly and as we speak. This way, the governor should know exactly what’s being delivered through a private-sector supply chain within their states, as well as through the Project Airbridge"
955,1,". So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. Not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s. We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example"
956,2,"We should ban genetically modified crops.  So, we think that in the future, genetic testing, for instance, which is very popular and often used to determine bloodlines, should be banned, because it has the effect of making people's genes, which are incredibly similar to someone else's genes, and putting them back into a sort of genetic algorithm that tries to make them as similar as possible"
957,2,".  We're okay with allowing people to get genetic testing for a limited purpose, like if they're planning on having a child, or if they're planning on having a child after a certain age, but we think that genetic testing should be banned.  We're okay with allowing people to get genetic testing for a limited purpose, but we think that genetic testing, in general, should be banned"
958,2,".  Our first argument is that this allows for racial discrimination.  Consider that, for instance, if you have a white, in the united states, and you want to select a gene that might be associated with white people, you might go to a black person's house and pick up a gene that might be associated with black people, but then you might not be able to use that gene to select a gene for use in a lab"
959,2,".  So, ultimately, this is discriminatory, because it's based on something that's incredibly racist.  Our second argument is that this is harmful for the environment"
960,2,".  So, for instance, when people in the US use genetic testing to determine where they're going to have children, we think that it's likely that they're going to select for a certain gene that could ultimately be harmful for the rest of the country"
961,2,".  For instance, if you have a gene for susceptibility to a certain type of diabetes, and a certain gene was found, and the rest of the country decided to do a genetic test on it, it might be possible that the US would use that to select for a gene for something like cystic fibrosis"
962,2,".  We think that it's likely that the US would use this to select for a gene for something like cystic fibrosis, and not use it to select for anything else.  We think that this would ultimately be harmful because, ultimately, the health of the rest of the country would be worse if people had access to these genetic tests.  So, ultimately, because of this, we should ban genetic testing.  Thank you"
963,2,.  Thank you.
964,2,"We should legalize sex selection. So, in this debate, we're going to argue that countries should ban sex selection, in general, and we're going to explain why we think that the current laws around the world are unacceptable. So our first argument is that we should protect the health of the child"
965,2,". We think that when a child is conceived, they should be given the opportunity to have a sex or to try on a dress or a suit or a bikini or a swimsuit or a sexy uniform or a lollipop. After all, the child isn't legally allowed to consent into harm or to consent into harm, and there's a reason why people are not allowed to do that"
966,2,". We think that there's an obligation, a reciprocal obligation, on the part of the state to take care of the health of the child, to try and make the child as healthy as possible"
967,2,". And, in particular, when there's a lack of access to contraception or when there's a lack of access to birth control, we think that this is particularly harmful because the state has an interest in ensuring that the child is healthy and not harmed. Our second argument is that we think that this is cruel to the child"
968,2,". So, in the same way that we wouldn't let people get tattoos, we think that we shouldn't let people get piercings or tattoos. So, right now, it's perfectly legal to get a piercing or a tattoo if the person is at risk of doing so. But we're okay with preventing people from getting piercings or tattoos if they're at risk of doing so"
969,2,". We're okay with taking away the piercing or the tattoo if it's a minor, if it's for a minor injury. We're okay with letting the person live with the piercing or the tattoo if it's a lifelong decision, because we don't think that the state should be forcing anyone to do these types of things"
970,2,". We're okay with letting people choose not to do it, but we think that the state should have the ability to do these things in a reasonable and humane way. And we're okay with regulating those types of activities, such as requiring certain safety regulations, such as limiting the amount of pain to the individual. We think that it would be a mistake to ban these types of things"
971,2,". We're okay with regulating things like race or gender or religious discrimination, but we don't think that the state should be imposing these kinds of decisions on people. We think that in the same way that we don't let people get tattoos, we shouldn't let them get piercings or tattoos, and that we should keep the traditional laws that we have right now"
972,2,". Our last argument is that we think it's arbitrary what a person's sex is supposed to be. So, let's imagine that you had two girls, one of them is a blue-eyed, one of them is a white-eyed, and you had a black man and a white woman. We think that the race would be determined by lottery in this instance"
973,2,". Obviously, it would be racist to let people choose the other sex, but that's just the lottery of birth for the lottery of birth. We think that people shouldn't be discriminated against just because they have a different sex. We think that in the same way, we shouldn't discriminate against people because of their sexual preference, even if it's discriminatory"
974,2,". So, ultimately, we think that in the same way that we don't let people choose to be racist, we shouldn't discriminate against people because of their sexual preference. For all these reasons, we should legalize sex selection. Thank you."
975,2,"We should further exploit sustainable energy.  So by this we mean to say that governments should increase the use of technologies that are not currently common in much poorer countries, in much larger, industrialized countries, and that we think are important to the sustainability of our own civilization.  So two reasons"
976,2,".  So two reasons.  The first is that there's an obligation to do something about global warming.  This is obvious, but we think that there's a moral obligation to do something about global warming.  It's clear that this is a moral obligation because people are directly or indirectly responsible for the harm that they cause by having a less developed and less developed culture"
977,2,".  We think that we have an obligation to step in to help them.  We think that's an obligation that's being imposed upon us because of some kind of moral defect in our society.  But we think that there's a moral defect in global warming that we need to fix, and that's global warming"
978,2,".  And we think that by doing something about it, by creating a moral obligation that we're placing upon ourselves, that's being placed upon us by our own government, and by imposing upon ourselves, we would be doing something that is ultimately good for the whole of humanity"
979,2,".  We think that this is the moral obligation that we place upon ourselves and that's being placed upon us by our own government.  We think that because global warming and its harms are immense, because it's going to harm millions of people and the whole of humanity, that it's something that we need to fix and something that we need to do right now.  And we think that's good"
980,2,".  And we think that's good.  We think that the second reason is that there's a duty to step in to help other people.  We think that because there's a moral obligation that you have to help other people, because there is an obligation that you place on yourself to help other people, we think that it's clear that you have an obligation to help other people"
981,2,".  We think it's clear that you need to act now in order to prevent global warming from going to make people sick, to help people in developing countries to develop, and ultimately to help everyone in the developed world.  And for this reason, we support the motion."
982,2,"We should abandon artificial intelligence.  So, in this debate, we're going to argue that we should abandon artificial intelligence, or AI, for short, because we think that it poses a threat to humanity and to other animals, and that ultimately it doesn't fulfill the goals of intelligence, which is to learn from the past and to understand the world around us"
983,2,".  We think that there are two main reasons why we should abandon artificial intelligence.  The first is that we think that it's going to be harmful for the future of humanity.  Recognize that, right now, when people think about intelligence, they think about super intelligence, and they think that there's no way that that intelligence is going to be super"
984,2,".  What's wrong with that? Because, in the future, super intelligence is going to outcompete us.  It's going to outcompete us in a few ways.  First, in the economic sphere"
985,2,".  First, in the economic sphere.  Recognize that when you have this competition, you are going to lose out on all economic levels, on all political levels, because there's a price to pay for that superior intelligence, and there's only one level of intelligence, one level of knowledge that you can access.  So, in the future, it's going to be a disadvantage to the average person in the society"
986,2,".  We think that this is actually very harmful, because it means that you're going to be outcompete, in a negative way, even if there is a super intelligence that we can't access"
987,2,".  We also think that in the future, there's going to be more political instability, because now you have this competition between different states, and different actors, and we think that that is going to lead to more conflict, and more instability, and we think that that is very detrimental"
988,2,".  The second reason for abandoning artificial intelligence is that we think it's going to be harmful to the development of other technologies.  Recognize that, right now, it's very difficult for scientists to access the data that they need to do their research"
989,2,".  They need to have access to the code, and they need to have access to the hardware, and they need to have access to the code, and they need to have access to the hardware, and there's a lot of barriers to overcome, in order for people to access that.  But in the future, things are going to change"
990,2,".  But in the future, things are going to change.  We think that, right now, it's very likely that, in the next ten years, we're going to have better access to these types of things"
991,2,".  We're going to be able to access things like the human genome, we're going to be able to access things like our own genes, and these are going to be things that are going to change the way we use technology in the future"
992,2,".  We think that, for instance, if we're able to sequence the human genome, we're going to be able to look for genes that may indicate that we have a connection to the human race, and to other species.  We're going to be able to look for genes that indicate that we have a connection to our own species, and to other species"
993,2,".  We're going to be able to look for genes that indicate that we have a connection to our own species, and to other species.  We think that these are going to be the best way to go about solving problems in the future.  But, in the future, things are going to change.  We think that, right now, when people think about technology, they think about it being a few steps ahead of the great leap"
994,2,".  But in the future, things are going to change.  We think that, right now, there's only one type of technology, that is being developed, that's being used in the developed world"
995,2,".  We think that there's going to be more of a competition between different states, and different actors, and therefore, you're going to be able to get better access to all of these different types of technology, which means that you're going to be able to solve for all of these problems more effectively.  For all these reasons, we should abandon artificial intelligence.  Thank you."
996,2,"We should abandon social media, and we should probably abandon it for a couple of reasons.  The first is that social media is very bad.  So why is? I'll tell you shortly why I think it's obvious that social media is bad.  But the problem is that many people, perhaps even a lot of people, don't know why it's bad"
997,2,".  And I'll tell you later why I think it's important to establish a baseline norm where people don't talk about things that are very intimate in private on their cell phone, where they can't talk about things that are very personal on their cell phone.  But I'll also tell you why it's bad in a broader sense"
998,2,".  So first, I think that it's bad because you get distracted by all of these external things.  You see all of the benefits of having a one-on-one time with someone, with someone that's your significant other or that you just have a one-on-one time with someone that's a significant other.  But these things aren't all that important"
999,2,".  But these things aren't all that important.  And I'll show you why in a minute why these are all things that are bad.  But secondly, I think that what's important is that I think that this is just a way for people to express what's really important.  And I'll explain why in a minute why this is a way of life that people should try to live"
1000,2,".  So why do I think this is a way of life? It's a way of life in which you don't really have to have very intimate things with people that you could be with in real life, and that's important.  Because I'll show you in a minute why this is a way of life that people should be allowed to have, but shouldn't be banned outright"
1001,2,".  I'll also tell you later why this is a way of life that people should be allowed to have.  But I'll also tell you later why it's bad for society.  So why do I think it's harmful? First, it's bad for you"
1002,2,".  It's bad for you because it's it's it encourages people to take risks, to take on risks, to take on things like job offers, it encourages people to be risk averse, to not be satisfied with things that they've been offered.  So it encourages you to do things like use your imagination and to think about things that you never thought about before"
1003,2,".  It encourages you to go to places that you never thought about before and to think about things that you never thought about before.  It encourages you to be more risky a person, and to be more risky a person in a world where all of the things that I just said about why it's bad for society are also true, and there's no real reason not to ban it"
1004,2,".  But second, I think that this is a way of life that people should try to go to, and it's one that's very good.  It's one in which you don't have to have this level of emotional dependence on other people that you have to worry about.  It's one in which you can be with your significant other, and that's a good thing.  The second thing I'd like to talk about is why it's bad for society"
1005,2,".  So, when you talk about how it gets distracted, you're probably talking about a reason that people do it in the first place.  It's because some of the benefits that are accrued from social media are things that are fairly intrinsic to the way that society functions, and in the same way that people can communicate with each other in real life, these are things that are incredibly important"
1006,2,".  And it's important to me as someone who is a woman to think about how much would it be good if we were able to communicate with each other on our cell phones? It's important to me as someone who is a man to think about how much it would be good if we could communicate with each other on our cell phones? These are things that are intrinsic to our society, and they're important to each person in"
1007,2,"society, and they're important to each person in their life"
1008,2,".  It's not important for the government or any other individual to tell them what's good for them.  It's not important for anybody to tell them how to live their life.  It's not important for anybody to tell them what's good for them.  We need to let people do what is in their best interest, and if social media is a way of life that we think is important, I think that we should definitely ban it"
1009,2,.
1010,2,"We should legalize organ trading, and we should do so in a way that we see fit, in a way that we see fit for our own sake.  I have three arguments for why we should legalize organ trading today.  The first is about the obligation of governments to step in to make sure that their citizens are protected"
1011,2,.  Recognize that governments around the world have an obligation to their citizens in order to maintain their citizens' security and their safety
1012,2,".  Recognize that in many countries around the world, such as america or britain, there is a ban on exporting certain products, or certain natural resources, because of the risks that they might have to become organ donors, or they might not have the money to pay for this transplant"
1013,2,".  Recognize also that in some countries, such as germany or britain, there is a ban on importing certain animals, because of the risk of being eaten by ravenous ravenous people, or that their meat might not be edible"
1014,2,".  So, we think that it's clear that the people who live there, the people who are most in need in any country, have an obligation to step in to protect their citizens' safety and security.  We also think that, in general, the laws should be consistent to allow for this to happen, and for good reason"
1015,2,".  We think that laws concerning things, like international trade, are inconsistent, and it would be much more desirable if, for instance, we could ban something that is natural, and yet we didn't do so, for instance.  But, you might say, that's not an objection, because we have other laws that don't have this kind of problem"
1016,2,".  So, we think that laws concerning things like, say, human rights, should be consistent"
1017,2,".  Why do I care so much about human rights? And, I respond, because it's not like I'm an individual, but I am a member of a collective society, and I am part of a collective society, therefore, I have an obligation to the people who live there, I have an obligation to them in order to maintain their safety and security"
1018,2,".  But, we also think that, in principle, we have an obligation to do this, because it's a matter of basic human dignity, that we want to preserve.  And, the other team's saying that, hey, it's not such a big burden to bear, but, but, sure, we'll live in a world where we don't have any organ trading, where it's just a matter of natural policy, that we don't do this, and so on"
1019,2,".  But, the next thing that I'm going to say is that, ultimately, it would be preferable if we didn't have this type of organ exchange.  So, we think that it's good if we keep our options open, so that people can choose to do this, but that we should allow people to do it in their own interest, and that we should not ban this"
1020,2,".  But, ultimately, we think that there is a duty here, and that we're acting on it, because it's citizens' interest, or in their own interest, that is in danger.  So, for all these reasons, we should legalize organ trading.  Thank you."
1021,2,"We should abandon television.  So, in this debate, we're going to argue that countries should ban television.  We're going to say that this will take place over a period of say five years and that after that period, countries will gradually move towards a system like a flat tax, where the same resources are allocated to all people.  So with this in mind, we have three arguments for you"
1022,2,".  The first is that we think that the public has a negative conception of the media.  So, I think it's important to note that the public has a negative conception of the media.  So the public sees the media as this thing that they're not allowed to access, and this is a sort of echo chamber for people who don't want to be exposed to ideas that might be dangerous or that might be upsetting to them"
1023,2,".  But the problem with this is that we think that the people who are most vulnerable in our society, in our society's most vulnerable places, are the people that are most in need of access to information"
1024,2,".  So for example, when people in the developing world, when people in the developing world don't have access to television, they don't have access to the ability to sort of use that media to like learn about the developing world or to like learn about things in the developing world, because they don't have access to the media to learn about these things"
1025,2,".  And this is a problem because, first of all, it makes it more likely that these things are going to be like the same sort of thing that we're looking at in the developed world"
1026,2,".  We're looking at, for example, in the developed world, things like the UN and things like the BBC, where there's a lot of media coverage of the developing world, and it's easy to be like sort of lumping these things together with the developing world, and lumping it in with the developed world"
1027,2,".  And this is a problem because, when you're looking at these things in the developed world, they're like the ones that are most vulnerable, the ones that are most like in need of attention, are the ones that are most likely to be harmed, and the ones that are most capable of benefiting, are the ones that are most capable of benefiting"
1028,2,".  So we think that the developed world is really at a disadvantage.  We think that when you're looking at these things in the developed world, it's important to look at the ones that are closest to you, to listen to the ones that are closest to you"
1029,2,".  And I think that what the developed world is uniquely lacking in is access to the ones that are closest to you, and that access to the ones that are closest to you, is one of the biggest advantages that they can have, because it means that the people that are closest to you are closer to you than they otherwise would be"
1030,2,".  And this is also a problem because, for example, if you were to have like a very like conservative government, you're probably not going to be able to have access to things like the UN or things like that, if you're a very liberal government, and you're not going to be able to listen to the ones that are closest to you.  Because these are the ones that are closest to you, you're closest to them"
1031,2,".  And if you're a country that is only going to listen to one group, you're not going to listen to all of them.  And I think that that's the biggest problem.  Because, if you're only listening to one group, you're not really giving them all the same opportunities to succeed"
1032,2,".  So, for example, if you're a country that's very religious, like like a very conservative country, and you're not going to give them the same sort of space to succeed, because you're not giving them all the same opportunities to succeed, you're not giving them all the same access to opportunity, you're not giving them all the same access to success"
1033,2,".  And I think that it's also important to note that, if you're going to have a country that's very large, like the united states, and you're not going to give them the space to succeed, because you're not giving them all the same opportunities to succeed"
1034,2,".  So, ultimately, we think that this is a problem because, in the end, it's the countries that are closest to you, the ones that are closest to you, are the ones that are closest to you, and we think that that's a problem.  But I also think that, in the end, this isn't really about the money"
1035,2,".  It's about the ability to connect with people across the globe, and I think that a lot of the time, the reason that television is such a big part of our culture is because we want to connect with people across the globe.  And, in the end, that's the biggest reason"
1036,2,"We should ban surrogacy.  So, in this debate, we're going to argue that countries should ban surrogate births, and they should do this in a strict way, by making it so that people cannot get a surrogate, can't take advantage of a surrogate, in the same way that they can't use a surrogate in the same way that they want to.  We have three arguments for why we think this should be the case"
1037,2,".  The first is that we think that there are certain situations, in which a person has a legitimate interest in the child that they are adopting.  So, let's imagine that you're a wealthy country, and you want to create a new country for the people that you're adopting to live in"
1038,2,".  In the united states, there are certain laws that prevent people from adopting, certain restrictions that exist, that prevent people from being able to use certain birth control, certain other types of birth control, in certain circumstances.  So, let's imagine that you're a wealthy country, and you want to create a country, that has very high quality of life, for the citizens of that country"
1039,2,".  So, you want to create a country, in which you want to create a new state, that is, in which you want to create a new community, that is, that is, that is, that is safe, and that you want to make your citizens feel safe and happy"
1040,2,".  And, in the united states, these are the types of restrictions that are put on people, in the united states, that prevent them from being able to create a safe and happy community for the citizens of that country.  We think that these are entirely justified"
1041,2,".  We think that these are entirely justified.  We think that the state should intervene to limit the freedom of movement, to limit the freedom of speech, and to protect a certain class of people, in order to protect those people.  We think that, in the same way that we limit people's freedom of speech, in order to protect people from being abusive or dangerous, we should ban surrogate births"
1042,2,".  But we think that, in the same way, we should ban a particular type of birth control, because it is clearly dangerous, and it is clearly harmful to the health of the child that you are adopting.  Our second argument is that we think that, in certain instances, surrogacy is simply a good thing"
1043,2,".  So, let's imagine that you're going to have a child, that you are going to have no idea about, that you're going to give birth to, and you want to give that child to someone, that you don't know, but you think is going to be a long-term companion, that you're going to love and take care of.  We think that in this instance, surrogate birth is perfectly fine"
1044,2,".  So, in this instance, we think it would be perfectly fine for the state to ban these types of birth control, in order to give those people a better quality of life.  We don't think that the state should ban something that is perfectly safe"
1045,2,".  And, in fact, we think that the state should be very careful in these instances, to make sure that people are able to have this type of good quality of life, and that they aren't doing so, when they shouldn't"
1046,2,".  And, in fact, we think that there is a clear benefit to the child that you are giving to in this instance, that you're giving to a family that is not only going to be very wealthy, but also very well-off, and we don't think that the state should intervene to prevent them from doing so"
1047,2,".  Our third argument is that we think that, in the same way that we ban other forms of birth control, we should also ban surrogate births.  So, let's imagine that you're going to have a baby, and you want to give that baby to someone that you don't know, but you think is going to be a long-term companion"
1048,2,".  We think that, in the same way that we ban other forms of birth control, we should also ban surrogate births"
1049,2,".  So, in the US, we think that there are certain restrictions that prevent people from giving birth to certain babies, that prevent them from being able to use certain types of birth control, or that prevent them from having access to certain types of medical care, in certain circumstances.  We think that these are completely justified, and for these reasons, we should ban surrogate births"
1050,2,.  Thank you.
1051,2,"We should limit judicial review, and we should limit what we can do from within the legal system, but we think that the legal system has been grossly abused, and we think that judicial review is one of the checks that's needed, one of the few checks that we have in a truly free and open society"
1052,2,".  So, we have three arguments for our side: the first is about the principle of self-governance, and the second is about the importance of judicial independence.  So, on the principle of self-governance"
1053,2,".  So, on the principle of self-governance.  We think that the state is fundamentally coercive, and that without some sort of guiding principles, without some sort of ethical code that we can use to guide our actions, that we would be able to lead the country in disastrous ways, to lead the country in ways that we didn't want, and to be ruled by other people"
1054,2,".  But, we think that, in the status quo, the government is not able to do so.  It's not able to dictate to other people what they're going to do, it's not able to dictate to the people the way they're going to behave, and it's not able to dictate to the people the moral code that they would have to follow"
1055,2,".  But, we think that this leads to a system in which the government is essentially a coercive body, and people cannot predict, they cannot predict how the government is going to behave in certain ways"
1056,2,".  People are made to feel like they are not going to have their own morality or ethics, and they are not able to predict how the government is going to act in certain ways, and we think that this leads to people being unjust, and we think that this is what is stopping people from being just and good"
1057,2,".  For example, in the united states, a judge is free to interpret the law in any way that he sees fit, and people are not able to opt out to or to stop that.  But this leads to a system in which the government is essentially unaccountable, and people are unable to predict their own rights, which are limited as they are not able to predict in advance what they're going to get"
1058,2,".  We think that, fundamentally, this is a harmful system, and it's one that we need to get rid of.  And for these reasons, we should limit judicial review."
1059,2,We should abandon speed limit enforcement.  So we're going to present to you two arguments for our side this evening
1060,2,".  The first is that we think there are a few instances in which speeding should be banned and that those instances are not in instances in which the benefits outweigh the harms that, and the second is that speed limits are in in themselves an unjust construct and that we think that banning them would be an unjust way to get atlantic to enforce them"
1061,2,".  So first, why do we think there are some instances in which speeding should be banned? We think that there are a few cases in which speeding should be banned.  The first is when the person who's going to be caught is an aggressor, and the second is when there are harms that are intrinsic to speeding.  So on the first point, on aggressor"
1062,2,".  So on the first point, on aggressor.  We would say that the standard for when someone is in need of a speeding ticket is aggression, and we would say that you should intervene to limit that aggression in cases when it's obvious that there's an individual that is doing something bad, and the other person is doing something good"
1063,2,".  The problem with this is that you can't intervene to make someone's behavior better, and the reason for this is that it's bad for you to try to make someone's behavior better by telling them that you can do something about it, because it doesn't do anything to help you in reality.  In the same way, we think that you should never intervene to make someone's behavior better in any way"
1064,2,".  The only reason why you should ever intervene in this is that you're trying to stop them from harming themselves, and if you catch them in the act of speeding, you could cause them to have a serious injury"
1065,2,".  But now, we don't care if a speeding ticket was issued because it's not in my hands, or if it's in someone's hands, we think that you should intervene to make sure that their behavior is not harming others"
1066,2,".  For instance, imagine if I was driving and I was going to get a speeding ticket, and I wasn't able to prove that I was driving and I was going to get a speeding ticket, since I would have been stopped, I would have to go to the police, who might know my identity and who I was and might know a lot more about me than I thought they would"
1067,2,".  We think that the only way you can prove that you were driving and that you should be able to get a speeding ticket is if you actually were driving, because it's not in your hands, it's not in your control, and you're being stopped.  In the same way, we don't think that you should ever expect to catch an actual speeding ticket"
1068,2,".  The only reason why we have traffic laws is that we want to stop people from harming each other.  But this is an impossible standard because traffic doesn't need to be like like a problem in a certain area, it needs to be spread across many areas, and it doesn't need to be this widespread thing where it's happening where it's so frequently that it's not even noticed"
1069,2,".  And furthermore, we think that the government's case is just, in general, that if I'm driving, I shouldn't be penalized, but I'm not sure that's true, because it's not clear to me why if I'm driving alone in the car, I shouldn't be penalized"
1070,2,".  We think that traffic needs to be spread out when it's when it needs to be spread, and that's what you need to consider when you're talking about speeding.  Because clearly, this is something that you need to consider when you're talking about something so personal as speeding.  We also think that the harms of speeding are not intrinsic to the driver that's driving"
1071,2,".  We think that, rather, they're intrinsic to the society that's allowing them to do these things.  And we think that when you ban something like speeding, you're essentially penalizing the driver for violating a law that's designed to protect them.  Our second argument is about the just state.  So what we mean by the state is that the state is a coercive apparatus.  It's the only one"
1072,2,".  It's the only one.  People are afraid to leave, it's the only one.  And in order to get people to go to the state, you need a coercive apparatus that"
1073,2,"We should further exploit mixed-use development.  Mixed-use development is a development method that allows for multiple buildings to be built on a single site, creating a dense, dense urban area, while leaving the ground open for the general public to walk and to jog.  We think that this is a good thing"
1074,2,".  We think that this is a good thing.  We think that it increases the quality of life in the area, and we think that it's one of the few tools for creating a dense, vibrant urban area.  With that in mind, we have three arguments for our side.  The first is that we think that this allows for greater density"
1075,2,".  We see that when you build a single tower, you're taking a large amount of space for the people living in that area.  We think that, for instance, when you allow people to live in the same building, you're taking a large amount of space for the people with whom you are building the tower.  We think that this is unacceptable"
1076,2,".  We think that, for instance, when a developer wants to build a tall building, and then build a small building next to that tower, you're taking an enormous amount of space for people to live in the lower classes, for the lower classes to live, for the lower class to be able to shop, for the lower class to be able to live in the lower class, for the lower class to be able to shop, and for the"
1077,2,"the lower class to be able to shop, and for the lower class to be able to live its life lower, and for the lower class to be able to live a better life"
1078,2,".  We think that this is unacceptable.  We think that when you allow developers to use tower blocks, you're taking an enormous amount of space for the lower class, and the lower class in general, to live in, to shop, to be able to shop, to live in, for the lower class.  We think that this is unacceptable"
1079,2,".  We think that this is unacceptable.  We think that you need to separate these people from the general public and allow them to live in the areas where they're being developed, where they're being developed, so that they can be better off, better able to support their families, better able to have access to the services that they need, and better able to be an active part of the community"
1080,2,".  We think that this is one of the few tools that we have for creating density, and we think that it's one that we should further exploit.  Our second argument is that we think that this is a good way of developing infrastructure.  We see that when you allow tower blocks, you're giving the opportunity to put a large amount of money into infrastructure"
1081,2,".  We see that in the early twentieth century, when the first skyscraper was built in the US, when the first train was built in england, these were all the things that the country had to put in place to support the construction of these large buildings.  We see that the same thing is happening right now, with tower blocks"
1082,2,".  We see that the state is putting a lot of money into building new subway lines, and we think that this is a good thing to put money into.  We see that the state is putting money into building new roads, and we think that this is a good thing to put money into.  We think that building these things up, and putting these things in the ground, is something that's generally a good thing"
1083,2,".  We think that when you have a dense urban area, it's better able to support the type of commerce that is required to support the types of activities that people want to do, and for the type of people that are being supported.  We think that this is generally beneficial for the health of the city, and for the well-being of the people living there, and for the well-being of the city"
1084,2,".  Our third argument is that we think it's good for the environment.  We see that when you have a dense urban area, when you have a dense urban area, there's less of a need for urban agriculture"
1085,2,".  We see that when you have a dense urban area, you're less likely to have the type of population density that makes it possible for the environment to be preserved, for the environment to be preserved, for the local wildlife to be preserved, for the local wildlife to be able to survive, and for the local ecosystem to survive"
1086,2,".  We think that this is generally a good thing, and we think that there are many areas in the world that don't have these things, that don't have the density that makes it possible for the environment to be preserved, and that these areas need to be kept in nature"
1087,2,".  For instance, if you live in a city that's built up around a natural area, such as in the middle of a forest, and then you have a city that's built up around a river, we think it's likely that the density that would otherwise prevent"
1088,2,We should further exploit filibusters
1089,2,".  So we're going to tell you why we think that in a world in which we are moving toward a world where public and private actors are more influential and are able to shape policies and are able to enact more democracy, only in the worst case, we're going to see politicians enact less policy, less substantive policies, and in the worst case we're going to see individuals who are less informed, less"
1090,2,"to see individuals who are less informed, less informed about important issues, and we think that this is something that should be avoided"
1091,2,".  But with that in mind, we have three arguments.  The first is that this limits the rights of the people.  So we think that on a basic level, the right to be left and the right to vote are limited to certain rights that the government has to give to certain people"
1092,2,".  We think that this is, by definition, something that we should have in common, and that this is limited to things like the right to life and the right to freedom of speech.  But we think that in today's society, the right to vote, the right to a fair trial, these are rights that are being limited to certain people"
1093,2,".  For example, in america, you can't vote in a political election that's within days of the election, and in some states you can't vote at all.  We don't think that, in this modern society, these rights should be applicable equally across the board"
1094,2,".  The other side has to defend that in the same way that the right to vote was, we think, limited to certain people, we should limit the right to vote to the same extent.  Now the other team might say that, "" well, these people are being forced to change their vote, which means that they're being coerced, but look, the alternative is no longer democracy, "" but we don't think that's good enough"
1095,2,".  We think that, in general, it's okay to limit people's freedom to, you know, do things like register absentee or vote in person, but that's not the same"
1096,2,".  We think that, in order for rights to be meaningful, they have to be limited in some way or another, that by limiting the right to vote, you're forcing people to be conform to certain norms or be conform to certain laws, these are laws that you can't just change, these are these are laws that are, you know, set in stone, and they're being enforced in a way that is unfair to people"
1097,2,".  For example, in america, you have a right to a fair trial, but in america, the trial can't be made a choice between the trial and the verdict, and the trial has to be concluded in order to keep the right to the trial"
1098,2,".  This doesn't mean that you have to like go to court to decide who's going to get the punishment and who's not, it's about how you're going to go to be punished and what the punishment is going to be.  We think that, ultimately, we should let people do what they want.  We should let people give what they want and we should encourage them to do what is in their best interest"
1099,2,".  The other side might say that, "" oh, well we'll limit people's freedom in like some cases, but we should, you know, have limits on how much freedom we can limit people's freedom, "" but this isn't how we're going to limit freedom.  We think that, ultimately, the only way we can limit people's freedom is when there's an asymmetry of information"
1100,2,".  So, when we force people to conform to certain laws or when we force people to conform to certain norms, we limit their freedom.  We think that, ultimately, this is unfair to both sides of the house.  We think that people, especially the poor, don't have access to the information to make good decisions, and that's what's limiting their freedom.  So we should limit the freedom of the poor."
1101,2,"We should ban racial profiling.  So, in this debate, we're going to argue that the US should prohibit racial profiling, also known as the "" white flight "" to other countries, and also known as the "" backlash "" if you prohibit it.  So, in the US, we think that the police should stop stopping people for traffic violations"
1102,2,".  They shouldn't be stopping people for traffic violations, and they shouldn't be stopping people for public urination, because those are acts that are inherently racist.  And we're going to tell you that the same thing should be prohibited in other countries.  Three arguments for you.  The first is that this is inherently racist"
1103,2,".  The first is that this is inherently racist.  In the US, for instance, it's very difficult to determine if someone is guilty or not based on race.  So, for instance, in the majority of the country, the criminal justice system can't determine if someone is guilty or not for certain races"
1104,2,".  For instance, if you're white and you're a member of the majority, then the criminal justice system can't determine if you're guilty or not.  So, ultimately, because of the inherent racism that exists in the united states, we think that this is inherently racist.  Our second argument is that we need to prevent the backlash that would otherwise be created by racial profiling"
1105,2,".  So, in the US, for instance, in the civil rights movement, it was very difficult to determine whether people were being racist.  Ultimately, it seemed to be the case that everyone in the country was racist, and it was the only way to make the country a better place"
1106,2,".  We think that one of the great lessons of the civil rights movement was that the best way to make the country a better place, was to get rid of the system of racism that was creating hate and the only way to do so was to make everyone in the country feel that they had to be racist"
1107,2,".  We think that one of the great lessons of the civil rights movement is that the best way to create a better place for people to live is to make everyone in the country feel that they have to be racist, rather than just to go and create an equal place for people to live"
1108,2,".  And we think that one of the great lessons of the civil rights movement is that ultimately, you need to be racist in order to prevent the backlash that would be created if you didn't have racial profiling.  Our third and final argument is that we think that the civil rights movement gave us a better understanding of how the world looked at a certain point in history"
1109,2,".  We see that in the US, for instance, the civil rights movement helped create a much more integrated society, one that included people of all different races"
1110,2,".  We think that one of the great lessons of the civil rights movement is that the country had to come to terms with the fact that slavery had become an accepted part of the US society, and that the only way to get rid of that was to get rid of the system of slavery.  And that's exactly what happened in the US, when the civil rights movement forced the abolition of slavery"
1111,2,".  And the reason for that is that the US was one of the only countries in the world that wasn't racist in the early twentieth century.  Many parts of the world were racist, such as the US and many parts of europe were racist, but the US was one of the few that wasn't"
1112,2,".  So, ultimately, because of the civil rights movement and because of the backlash that would ultimately arise if you banned racial profiling, we think it's clear that the US should continue to have racial profiling.  Thank you."
1113,2,"We should subsidize Wikipedia.  So, in this debate, we're going to argue that the US federal government should pay more money to subsidize the upkeep of wikis, should make it easier for people to use wikis to find information, and should subsidize, you know, people to use wikis to learn about the world.  Three arguments for why we think it should be done"
1114,2,".  The first is that we think that this will lead to a global culture of tolerance.  We think that when you have a more tolerant society, you're more likely to have tolerance for different groups.  When you have a more tolerant society, you're more likely to accept people of all different religions, and you're more likely to accept people of all different nationalities"
1115,2,".  So with this in mind, we think that when you have a more tolerant society, you're more likely to accept other people, even if you disagree with them.  We think that one of the biggest problems that the world has right now, where there's a huge divide between nations, is that people don't really accept other cultures"
1116,2,".  People don't accept muslims, people don't accept people of different races, and we think that one of the biggest things that the internet can do, besides just the fact that it's great for people to see people of all different races, is that it can provide a platform for people to learn about other cultures, and to interact with people from all different cultures"
1117,2,".  And when you have more of a tolerance, one of the biggest things that you can do is promote tolerance"
1118,2,".  We think that when you're more tolerant, you're more likely to have a more tolerant society, and that that's something that's good for people to have, because it means that you're more likely to have interactions with different cultures, and you're more likely to have an understanding of the world around you"
1119,2,".  You're more likely to have an understanding of the cultures that exist around you, which means that you're more likely to be tolerant of those cultures, and that's the best way to have an open society, one in which you can interact and coexist in a way in which you want to.  We also just think that it's important that this tolerance extends to different religions"
1120,2,".  In the status quo, different cultures are treated differently, even if they're not in conflict.  We think that one of the big things that the internet can do is promote tolerance.  So, for example, in the united states, there's a huge amount of hate speech, a huge amount of racism, a huge amount of sexism, and a lack of tolerance"
1121,2,".  One of the big things that the internet can do is allow people to have an understanding of other cultures.  It's something that can unite people of all different cultures and all different backgrounds in a way that's really important.  And when you have more of a tolerance, you're more likely to have an understanding of other cultures, and that's the best way to have an inclusive society"
1122,2,".  Our second argument is that we think this will lead to a more diverse set of ideas.  In the status quo, the united states is still very segregated, especially in terms of race.  But now we think that one of the biggest problems in the united states is that different cultures are treated differently"
1123,2,".  If you have a very white christian society, for example, and you have like a very black american society, and you have a very latino american society, and there's not really a lot of tolerance for people of other cultures.  We think that one of the biggest problems in the US is that different minority groups are treated differently than majority groups"
1124,2,".  For example, the chinese, for example, are treated differently than chinese, and that's one of the biggest things that's different between chinese and chinese culture.  We think that one of the biggest things that the internet can do is allow people from different backgrounds to have an understanding of one another's cultures"
1125,2,".  We think that one of the biggest things that's different between different cultures is that there's tolerance for one culture to exist alongside another culture, whereas that tolerance isn't allowed in the united states"
1126,2,".  So one of the biggest things that the internet can do is allow people from different cultures to interact and to share ideas, and we think that this is one of the biggest things that we can do for people to build understanding and tolerance.  And finally, we think that this is ultimately good for the economy"
1127,2,".  In the status quo, for example, you have a huge influx of immigrants because of the economy, but we think that one of the biggest things that the internet can do is encourage more people"
1128,2,We should abolish the america's electoral college.  The way that we've been able to elect presidents and vice presidents and to elect presidents and vice presidents over the years has been a mockery of the democratic process
1129,2,".  Many people, even in relatively liberal countries, feel that they cannot vote, that they cannot express themselves effectively because they are not allowed to vote in one place and one place alone.  They are prevented from voting in any way, shape, or form"
1130,2,".  We think that this is fundamentally unacceptable and that many citizens have an obligation to simply have a free and open democratic process, to have the political process that they want to have and to have the system that they want to have.  We think that the way that we have been able to elect presidents and to have a democratic process is a mockery of that process"
1131,2,".  We think that the the way that we've been able to have a democracy, the way that we've been able to have a market economy and to have a market economy and to have a free and open democratic process is a mockery of that process.  We think that, ultimately, it benefits only those who are in the minority or that are very powerful, and it harms everyone else"
1132,2,".  The other side is saying that people are being coerced to vote for certain candidates, but this is not true.  People are being coerced to participate in certain political processes, because if you don't vote in one election, you're effectively being forced to vote in every election.  We don't think that people are being coerced to participate in this process in any way, shape, or form"
1133,2,".  We think that, ultimately, it's important that we maintain a democracy, that we allow people to choose who they want to have and, moreover, that we let people choose the outcomes that they want to have.  And because of this, we think that the electoral college should be abolished"
1134,2,".  And we should abolish it in the United States, because it doesn't do any good for anyone, and it harms whoever can't control it.  Thank you."
1135,2,"Assisted suicide should be a criminal offense. So, we think that the state should make a few rules about when you can allow people to take their own lives. The first would be that people who are being assisted should be treated as criminals, and if they're not, then they shouldn't be punished"
1136,2,". And we think that the state should prevent these people from being punished if they're not guilty of the crime. So, our first point is that this puts the rights of the accused at risk"
1137,2,". So, I think it's clear that the right to life or the right to liberty or the right to speech or the right to religion or the right to free speech, or the right to self-harm or the right to a fair trial, and ultimately those rights don't apply to the accused, because they're not guilty of a crime. We think that the state should, on balance, try to minimize the rights of its citizens"
1138,2,". So, ultimately, if the state is successful in doing so, it will do so in a just way. So, in this instance, we think that the state should intervene and prevent these people from being punished. But I think that it's clear that the state would fail. The other side of this is that we don't think that the state should try to intervene in the private sector"
1139,2,". The reason for this is that in the status quo, there's a market of sorts for people who are incompetent, who are not qualified to be in charge of, to go and get an independent consultant, to go and have a private consultant, to hire a private investigator, to hire a private lawyer, to hire a private investigator, to do all these kinds of things"
1140,2,". And we think that the fact that you're not going to let the people who are being assisted get away with doing this, even if you want to, is a bad thing. Because ultimately, if the state is incompetent, it doesn't make any sense to let people be helped. So for all these reasons, we should criminalize assisted suicide. Thank you."
1141,2,"We should limit judicial activism.  So, in this debate, we're going to argue that states should limit their use of judicial activism, or juries and judges to a great extent, to ensure that people are not harmed in the process of going through the judicial system"
1142,2,".  We're going to do this through things like sentencing, through things like selecting juries, through things like criminal punishment, through things like driving restrictions, through things like the death penalty, through things like that.  We're going to do this in the form of a set of rules, or a set of principles, or something similar"
1143,2,".  We're going to say that these are things that are applied to the states, to the people that live within them.  We're going to say that these are generally unjust.  And we're going to explain why"
1144,2,".  And we're going to explain why.  The first reason that juries and judges have a right to, and should, and must use these tools in order to ensure that people aren't harmed, is that juries and judges are the only people that have access to these tools.  The only people that are capable of using them, are the judges and the jury"
1145,2,".  The only people that have access to these tools, are the people that they are a part of, are the judges and the jury.  So, in order for the judges and the jury to use the tools that they have, in order for the judge and the jury to be impartial, they need to ensure that they are not harmed by the decision that they make"
1146,2,".  And we think that the reason for this, is that if you're a judge or a jury, you are in a certain way an impartial person, you're someone that is only in the loop, that is only aware of the fact that you're a part of your community, of your community's community, of your community's culture, of your community's history, and of the decisions that you're making, and you have the ability to make"
1147,2,"you're making, and you have the ability to make those decisions in an unbiased way, you're able to make the decision that you think is the most fair, and the one that is most fair for the people that live within that community"
1148,2,".  And for that to be the case, we think it is important that the judge or jury don't use these tools in order to ensure that they're not harmed.  But, in reality, these tools can be incredibly harmful, especially when you're trying a case that's been made to be biased"
1149,2,".  Because, for instance, when you're deciding a case, you're biased in the way that you're going to make decisions, in the way that you're going to be unfair to a defendant, or to a victim, or to a witness, or to a crime"
1150,2,".  And these are tools that you're more likely to use, because you're more likely to make decisions that are prejudiced in your community, you're more likely to use the system to oppress people, to control them, to make them feel like they're less free, less happy, less happy, than you otherwise would be if you weren't doing so"
1151,2,".  And we think that that's a big problem, because it means that you're more likely to use those tools to oppress people, and you're more likely to use them in a way that's unjust.  So we think that, ultimately, if you're going to be a judge or a jury, you need to ensure that you're not using these tools, and that you're impartial in the process"
1152,2,".  And we think that that impartiality is more likely to be found when you use other tools, when you're impartial in the criminal justice system, when you use the criminal justice system to select juries, to select juries, to ensure that people aren't convicted of a crime, to ensure that people aren't convicted of a crime"
1153,2,".  All of these are tools that are more likely to be used when you're impartial in the criminal justice system, when you're impartial in the criminal justice system, when you're impartial in the criminal justice system, when you're impartial in the criminal justice system.  And for these reasons, we should limit judicial activism."
1154,2,"We should ban media conglomerates.  Media conglomerates are a huge threat to our society.  They are a huge threat to our culture and our way of life, and they do it incredibly inefficiently"
1155,2,".  They do things like they don't reflect the diversity of opinions that we hold in a democracy, and they don't reflect the diversity of opinions that we hold in a free society, because they simply do not reflect the diversity of opinions, that we hold in a free society.  With that in mind, we think it's important to ban these media groups"
1156,2,".  We think that these are a huge harm to our culture and to our way of life.  We think that they are a huge threat to our culture, and we think that they are incredibly inefficient and inefficient"
1157,2,".  We think that they're something that we need to get rid of, and the reason for this is that they do things like provide a bad example for young entrepreneurs, they don't provide a good example for young people to learn from, and they don't provide any sort of good example for young people to learn from, in any other way"
1158,2,".  So what we're going to say about these things is that we think that they're bad examples, and we think that they're bad examples from which to learn.  We think that there are a number of problems with the way that media typically works, and we think that by banning these types of media conglomerates, by banning the types of media that they produce, that you get rid of many of the problems"
1159,2,".  So, we think that there are a number of problems that these media entities do, and we think that by banning them, you get rid of them.  First, they're incredibly inefficient.  They're a drain on capital, they're a drain on resources, and they are not a sustainable way of getting your information"
1160,2,".  We think that if you ban these types of media, you get rid of them, and you don't get any sort of good news.  You get sensationalized news, you get sensationalized stories, and you get sensationalized stories that are likely to get clicks, that are likely to get views, and that's not good.  Secondly, they're incredibly inefficient.  We think that they're bad ways of getting your news"
1161,2,".  They're bad ways of getting your information.  The fact that they're all on television at the same time as live events and things like that means that they're all on television at the same time as live events and things like that.  They're all on television at the same time as live events, and they are all on television at the same time as live events"
1162,2,".  And this means that you end up, in the worst case, with a general lack of accountability, and you end up, in the worst case, with people who do not have a good understanding of what is happening in the real world, and you get that on television.  We think that you get a bad education, a bad example to learn from, and a bad example to learn from when you allow these types of media to exist"
1163,2,".  For these reasons, we should ban media conglomerates."
1164,2,"We should ban homeopathy.  Homeopathy is a practice which is based on the idea that you can cure disease by immersing yourself in a well.  You take a little bit of a medicine, say, an herbal or a plant, and then you soak your hand in it and say, "" oh, no.  "" And then you rinse off some water and say, "" oh, no"
1165,2,".  "" And then you wash your hands in the same way that you would wash your hands after you've taken a little bit of medicine or a little bit of an herb or something like that.  So you take a little bit of water and then you wash your hands in the same way.  It's all very very similar.  So the other side might say, "" oh, well there's no evidence that this works"
1166,2,".  "" But the other side might say, "" oh, well there's no evidence that it doesn't work.  "" But the other side might say, "" well, if you think that there's no evidence that it doesn't work, then maybe it's not that big of a burden to put on doctors to tell people that there is no evidence that it doesn't work.  And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that doesn't work"
1167,2,".  "" But the other side might say, "" well, maybe it's not as effective as other kinds of treatments.  "" So the other side might say, "" well, maybe that's not a good idea.  "" But the other side might say, "" well, maybe that's not a good idea because it's risky.  "" Or the other side might say, "" well, maybe that doesn't work.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that doesn't work"
1168,2,".  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that's not a good idea.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" But the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that's not good.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work"
1169,2,".  "" Or the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" So the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" But the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work"
1170,2,".  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" But the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" But the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe it's risky.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe it's risky"
1171,2,".  "" But the risk isn't too much because the risk is very low.  The other side might say, "" well, maybe it won't work.  "" But the other side might say, "" well, maybe it's risky.  "" And so the other side might say, "" well, maybe it's risky.  "" But the risk isn't that high.  The risk to the individual is very low.  So the other side might say, "" well, maybe that won't work"
1172,2,".  "" But the risk isn't that high.  And the risk to society is very low.  So for all of these reasons, we should ban homeopathy.  Thank you."
1173,2,"We should raise the corporate tax.  So by this we mean to say that we should tax all companies that are currently operating in the united states at some proportion to the GDP that they impose on their operations.  We might take a percentage of their profits or a percentage of their revenues and, you know, you might pay some sort of a dividend while they're operating in the united states"
1174,2,".  We think that if they're doing business in a country that doesn't have a corporate tax, they should be taxed at one rate or another.  We have a few reasons why we think this is a good idea"
1175,2,".  The first is that we think this is completely necessary to correct for the fact that corporations are taking advantage of the american people's resources more than they ever could have been doing in their home country.  We think that it's obvious that, for instance, there's a shortage of workers in the US"
1176,2,".  On paper, the unemployment rate is very high, but people are working even harder and getting less paid for their work than they ever were.  We think that the only way to get people to work harder and get more money is to have a higher tax rate"
1177,2,".  We think that this will drive up, you know, the wages down, and you know, people will have to pay more and more money for their wages, and the money will be more valuable"
1178,2,".  So we think that this will force corporations that are doing business in the united states to pay more and that, in turn, will encourage them to pay more and that, ultimately, this will have positive affects on the entire economy and improve the well-being of all people.  Our second argument is that we think this will lead to much merriment in the country"
1179,2,".  Right now, people are very invested in their own futures, and they plan for their own retirement, but they don't really have any retirement plans in place.  What this means is that, for instance, some people are taking money out to pay for their mortgages or for their kids' college, but they're not really planning for their retirement"
1180,2,".  What this means is that, if you raise the tax rate, you get rid of that flexibility.  People are going to be more likely to take their retirement money.  And what this means is that you get rid of these plans altogether, and you make people much more reliant on the state"
1181,2,".  People won't be able to plan for their retirement, because they're going to be working for the state for the rest of their life, and that means that you're going to have a much lower retirement plan in place, and they're going to be a lot like relying on the state when they're old, when they're elderly, when they're relying on the state for support"
1182,2,".  So we think that this is going to be a good thing for the economy writ large.  It means that people are going to be working much longer, it means that you're going to see more and more people participating in the labor market, and it means that you're going to have a healthier workforce.  For all these reasons, we should raise the corporate tax."
1183,2,"We should legalize ivory trade.  We think that in the status quo, the US is one of the largest consumers of ivory, and that it's a waste of money, because we have the infrastructure to produce more in the long term.  Our first argument is that it's a violation of international law.  So, in order for the US to have an ethical obligation, it has to abide by the law of the majority of states"
1184,2,".  This is in order to ensure that, for instance, the US doesn't step in and rule over another state, and that would be unjust.  So, in order for the US to have an ethical obligation, it has to abide by the law of the majority of states.  We think that this is, in essence, a violation of sovereignty"
1185,2,".  If the united states decides to invade another state, that is, to take it, and then rule over the state that is being invaded.  We think that it's unacceptable for the US to rule over other states, and to rule over a state that is not being attacked.  And moreover, in the status quo, the US is one of the largest producers of ivory in the world"
1186,2,".  It's true that the US is a poor place to buy ivory, but it is one of the largest importers of ivory, and we think that it's clear that the US is going to continue to be one of the largest importers of ivory, and one of the largest consumers of ivory, and that this is a violation of US law, and one of the few remaining checks on the US, as a sovereign state"
1187,2,".  Our second argument is that it's a poor use of funds.  In the status quo, the US is one of the few states that can afford to import ivory.  We see that the US is the only country in the world that can afford to import ivory, and that this is a major reason why the US has such a strong economy"
1188,2,".  Why is that the case? Well, first of all, we think it's important to recognize that the US is a very poor place to spend money.  We see that the US has a very low rate of return on investment, and the reason for that is that the US is a poor place to spend money"
1189,2,".  The reason for that is that, in order for the US to be a strong, wealthy, powerful country, it has to have economic stability, and that's not happening in the US.  We think that if you had the US buying and selling ivory, that this would then create economic instability, because there's no way that the US can buy back all of the ivory, in order to invest in its economy"
1190,2,".  And in the same way, we think that it's clear that if you had the US buying and selling ivory, that this would create economic instability, because there's no way that the US can invest in all of the ivory, in order to invest in its economy"
1191,2,".  And in the same way, we think that it's clear that if you have the US buying and selling ivory, that this would destabilize the US, and that this would lead to a trade war between the two countries, which would ultimately undermine the US economy.  For all of these reasons, we should legalize ivory trade.  Thank you."
1192,2,"We should fight environmental degradation.  So, in this debate, we're not gonna pretend that the environment is some sort of magical entity that we can't stop destroying.  We think that, in order for there to be sustainability, in order for there to be environmental protection, it's necessary that the state steps in and controls the environment in order to ensure that we don't destroy it"
1193,2,".  And in the status quo, it's obvious that the state is not doing enough.  We think that the state needs to step in to ensure that we don't destroy the environment, but it's also clear that the state is not doing enough"
1194,2,".  So, in order for there to be a balance between the state and the environment, in order for the state not to be destructive, we think it's necessary to create a balance between the two.  And the way that you do this in the status quo is by using the tools that are available to us.  So, for starters, we think that you need to have an understanding of the environment"
1195,2,".  You need to understand the cycles of the environment.  You need to understand the patterns that exist within the environment.  You need to know the ways that the environment can react to certain types of pollution, to certain types of weather, to certain types of environmental disasters"
1196,2,".  And in the modern day, with the proliferation of the internet and with the proliferation of technology, in the status quo, it's easy for people to get these things.  It's easy for people to find these things, and it's easy for people to make a decision, because they're not just looking at a schematic of the environment, but they're looking at an actual picture of the environment"
1197,2,".  It's something that they can look at and they can look at it and they can visualize the environment in a way that allows them to make better decisions.  It's something that they can look at and they can compare it to their own experience and to their own knowledge, and they can choose to do good or bad things, and we think that that's a good thing"
1198,2,".  It means that you're not destroying the environment, you're not destroying the cycle of destruction, and you're allowing for a better environment to be created.  We also think it's important to fight global warming"
1199,2,".  The biggest threat that humanity faces in the next one hundred years, according to the most recent data, is rising sea levels that are going to destroy many of the world's largest cities"
1200,2,".  These are the cities that are most at at risk of being flooded, that are most at a huge disadvantage, because these are the cities that are most directly on the coast, and these are the cities that are at the greatest economic disadvantage, because they're the biggest economic centers in the world, and they're the ones that are most capable of fighting global warming"
1201,2,".  And so, in order to fight global warming, you need to fight it in the coastal cities that are at the greatest economic and political advantage, and we think that that's what the coastal cities are at the greatest economic and political advantage in the world are, and for these reasons, we should fight global warming."
1202,2,We should abandon the sexual revolution
1203,2,".  So we want to say that in general, as a movement, the sexual revolution has been an incredibly positive thing for women, a tremendous amount of harm for the general populace, and we would say that if it continues, if it continues to grow, we would say that it necessarily undermines the ability of women to live the lives that they desire to live the lives that they desire to be lived in"
1204,2,".  And we think that this is ultimately a massive harm that the population has been subjected to.  We would say that, if anything, it would be a good thing to get rid of the sexual revolution, but we think that this is a good thing that we need to do in order to actually help women and fulfill the desires of the people that are currently being oppressed by the sexual revolution"
1205,2,".  So with that, our first point is that this is a poor way to start.  Recognize first, that this is a movement that has incredibly high expectations of its members.  This is a movement that claims to represent a full liberation for women, and yet, to many of the members, they are living very, very problematic, and certainly not good, lives"
1206,2,".  Women are not being able to have the full liberation, they're not being able to be fully empowered, they're not being able to be fully, fully validated, in the way that they are expected to be, or perhaps even to be expected to be.  So you have a problem of, first, a lack of validation.  And secondly, a lack of understanding"
1207,2,".  We think that, in the status quo, a lot of the women that are leading this are either, you know, extremely intelligent, they have particular talents, they are accomplished, they have worked hard, they have earned their way into the position that they are in, and we think that these women are, by and large, not good role models, and furthermore, we think that they are, you know, not good role"
1208,2,"we think that they are, you know, not good role models economically, you know, not good role models for the economy, not good role models for the economy writ large, and all of these things are important"
1209,2,".  We think that, for starters, you need to establish a baseline, and you need to set an example for women that they are able to be empowered and live the way that they want to be, rather than in a position that they, you know, don't, or don't have the autonomy to, and maybe not have the full autonomy to, if that's the desire that people have"
1210,2,".  We think that the way that you get this is by empowering women.  We think, ladies, that this is a fundamentally, you know, problematic way to start"
1211,2,".  Because recognize that there is a consent issue when it comes to these kinds of things, when it comes to, you know, sex, when it comes to sex, and when it comes to other things, when it comes to, you know, your education, your your your work, your life, these are all things that women, that women want to have, that women want to have, that are able to be empowered, and in the status quo, we are"
1212,2,"to be empowered, and in the status quo, we are a lot likely to get things wrong as a result of what we're doing"
1213,2,".  So, if you're going to start a movement that, you know, gives empowerment to women, that gives empowerment to women to be empowered and to live the way that they want to live, this is a movement that, I think, has a very clear and obvious standard for success.  This is the standard that we set as a society"
1214,2,".  We think that women are empowered if they have the ability to go away from the situation that they are in, if they have the ability to be in a situation where they think, if they have the ability to choose, if they have the ability to choose, that it is not something that they are going to be harmed by, that they're not going to be harmed by, but if something, you know, harms someone in their"
1215,2,"if something, you know, harms someone in their life because of it, if you have the ability to empower them, then you should"
1216,2,".  And I think that this is why you need to start by saying, ladies, that this is a movement that is going to work, and it's an effective way to start.  This is a movement that, you know, creates a"
